Manifest
--------

Every app project must have an <a href="psi_element://Configuration/Manifest/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:2">AndroidManifest.xml</a> 
file (with precisely that name) at the root of the project source set.
The manifest file describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components.
It also describes the essential information about your app to the Android
build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play.

It declares the following essential features of the application:
 - The app's package name;
 - The components of the app;
 - The permissions of the app;
 - The hardware and software features the app requires.

In Android Studio, the manifest file is created for you, and
most of the essential elements are added automatically as you build your app.
Check out the `AndroidManifest.xml` file included in this task.
