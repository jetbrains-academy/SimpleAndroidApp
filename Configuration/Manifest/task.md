Every app project must have an <a href="psi_element://Configuration/Manifest/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:2">AndroidManifest.xml</a> file (with precisely that name) at the root of the project source set. The manifest file describes essential information about your app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play.

It declares the following essential features of the application:
 - The app's package name
 - The components of the app
 - The permissions of the app
 - The hardware and software features the app requires
