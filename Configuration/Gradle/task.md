Gradle
------

As well as other android applications, your application will use [gradle](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin) as a build tool. It means all of the modules and external libraries or packages are compiled together according to the rules provided via `gradle.build` file.

In this course it is updated for you during the tasks, so you don't need to implement changes yourself, but all of them are provided for you to use in your further development. To use them properly you should check out [Gradle introduction](https://guides.gradle.org/building-android-apps/#review_the_top_level_gradle_build_file).

You can always come back to this task if you need some comments on the `build.gradle` structure.
