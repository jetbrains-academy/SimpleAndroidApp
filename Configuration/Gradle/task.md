Gradle
------

The Android Studio build system is based on [Gradle](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin). Therefore,
just like other Android applications, your application will use Gradle
as a build tool. What this means is that all of the modules and external libraries or packages are compiled
together according to the rules provided in the `build.gradle` file.


The project has its `build.gradle` file, and each module has one of its own. Use each module's `build.gradle`
file to control how the Gradle plugin builds your app. For more information about these files, see [Configure your build](https://developer.android.com/studio/build).



In this course, `build.gradle` is updated for you automatically with every task and you don't need to implement
changes yourself; however, all of them are provided for you to use in your further development.
