# Simple Android App course  (Educational Products version) [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)
<p>This is a sample Android app creation course by JetBrains Educational Products.</p>

  <p>The course contains both theoretical and hands-on tasks.
Theoretical tasks provide the basic information about the components of an Android app and their interactions.
The last two lessons consist of practical tasks where the student creates an app 
with two activities. The course also demonstrates the use of both regular unit tests and
instrumented unit tests that run on physical devices and emulators.</p>

  <p>Have fun and good luck!</p>
